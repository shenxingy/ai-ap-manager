# Progress — AI AP Operations Manager

## Project Start: 2026-02-26

Initial planning complete. Full documentation suite created covering:
- PRD (product requirements, user journeys, 15+ scenarios)
- System architecture (modules, data flow, event log design)
- Database ERD (all MVP tables with fields, keys, indexes)
- API design (all MVP endpoints with request/response examples)
- Rules engine design (match pseudocode, tolerance config, exception taxonomy)
- AI modules design (extraction, policy parsing, self-optimization, root cause)
- UI information architecture (all pages, components, table columns)
- Security & compliance design (RBAC, audit, data masking)
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E test cases)
- Milestone plan (week-by-week tickets)

**Next step**: Scaffold backend and frontend, implement DB models, start invoice upload flow.
